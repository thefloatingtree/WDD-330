                        <h3>Reading: "HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World"</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>CSS transforms, I've found, are only really useful when used in conjunction with transitions. Or, I guess, centering things. But there are better ways to do that.</li>
                                <li>Oh! I didn't know you could transform your origin. That's pretty neat!</li>
                                <li>Every time I read one of these textbooks and it mentions IE I'm so incredibly greatful that I pretty much no longer need to worry about supporting it since Edge has supplanted it. God bless all those developers that still have to support it.</li>
                                <li>Transition timing functions are still super interesting to me. It's also awesome that it supports raw bezier curves!</li>
                                <li>It's super neat that CSS supports keyframe animations.</li>
                                <li>A very good point that you should employ animations with a light hand.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I've used the HTML5 canvas a LOT. When I was first learning JS, I replicated a lot of classic arcade games with HTML5 canvas, it was a great way to learn!</li>
                                <li>Uh oh, looks like this book is using 'setTimeout' for drawing frames. Definitely don't do that. Use 'requestAnimationFrame' instead, it lets the browser decide when to run your code instead of being forced to run it on a timer.</li>
                                <li>SVG's are mega useful. They're much smaller, performant, and infinitely resizable! They don't work for photographs, but for simplified logos or icons they're perfect.</li>
                                <li>Drag and drop is very cool, I've never seen the event names for that interaction.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
