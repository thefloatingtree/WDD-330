                        <h3>Reading: "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition"</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>I really enjoy how lenient JavaScript is with its errors. It rarely crashes all the way excluding syntax errors. Like the book says this can be the root of pretty insidious problems, so it's still important to be diligent when it comes to error handling.</li>
                                <li>Strict mode is good! Although I don't often run into errors that come from strict mode.</li>
                                <li>I don't think I've ever used an alert to debug code. A good ol' 'console.log' is usually plenty!</li>
                                <li>I didn't know about 'console.trace' or 'debugger'! I'll look out for spots to use them.</li>
                                <li>I feel like try/catch is used mostly for interfacing with external systems. API calls and the like. Also does anyone actually use 'finally'?</li>
                                <li>I've worked at a bunch of different places, and I still haven't found anwhere that uses TDD. I'd like to try it out sometime though! Most of my personal projects are too small to warrant such a verbose methodology.</li>
