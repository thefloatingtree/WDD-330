                <h3>Reading: "Object Methods: this"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I didn't know you couldn't use 'this' in arrow functions! Y'know that probably explains a couple of bugs that I worked around before...</li>
                    <li>Oh man, I love love love objects with a chainable API. There's something so satisfying about chaining together a bunch of method calls. That probably comes from my time spent writing C# using the LINQ methods.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reading: "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Objects</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JavaScript is my favorite language for a bunch of reasons, but object literals are definitely a big part of that love. There's something so expressive about defining objects with just a pair of curly braces.</li>
                        <li>Oh man I use the ES6 property creation shorthand all the time. It's so much faster when you're building objects from a bunch of variables.</li>
                        <li>I forgot about the 'delete' keyword! I don't think I come across many situations where I want to remove a key on an object. But it's good to know you can!</li>
                        <li>The 'Date' object is simultaneously awesome and bad. There are some confusing API problems, but I do love how much it takes care of timezone problems.</li>
                        <li>Pretty ambitious of the author to try and explain RegEx! I usually have to relearn it everytime I find a situation that would benefit it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The Document Object Model</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I should have guessed but I didn't know you could spread a node list into an array! I think I'll start using that instead of 'Array.from(nodeList)'</li>
                        <li>I've been using 'getAttribute' and 'setAttribute' a lot in the little framework I've been building for this class!</li>
                        <li>Thank goodness that unless you're working on extremely legacy websites you no longer need to worry about supporting IE.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Events</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I didn't know there was a double click event! Pretty interesting, I don't think many web apps use this interaction</li>
                        <li>'preventDefault' is very useful in particular situations. The example I can think of off the top of my head is preventing the browser from navigating to a url on the click of an anchor tag. This is useful for SPA's especially that handle routing themselves, but still need to use anchor tags for accessibility.</li>
                    </ul>
