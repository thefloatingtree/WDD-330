                <h3>Reading: Instructions on Creating a Portfolio</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm already very familiar with git and GitHub! First few steps and setting up github.io was a breeze!</li>
                    <li>The dynamic table of contents section sparked a bit of inspiration in me! I really dislike writing js to manually manipulate the DOM after writing a full note taking web app for a previous web development class. So I decided to try my hand at programming a small framework to do some of the heavy lifting for me. I chose the syntax of alpine.js to serve as a template, mostly because it's dead simple but still very powerful! I got pretty far with it so far, enough to handle the dynamic table of contents at least! I still want to add reactivity, better expression execution, and a bunch more attributes!</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reading: Doing Stuff with Web Things</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I was curious about the difference between Cookies and LocalStorage. It seems like cookies are sent to the server in each HTTP header, which is news to me! I have several projects where I probably should have used localStorage instead of cookies haha.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reading (Watching?): Master Mobile UX</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yeah it's definitely interesting how the web has shifted from being mostly desktop dominated to now being mostly viewed through mobile devices! They make a good point that we should be designing for mobile first, since that's where our content is most likely going to be viewed.</li>
                    <li>I disagree that websites need to be rewritten from scratch to work on mobile devices. Responsive retrofitting is usually perfectly adequate!</li>
                    <li>Consolidate your user interfaces. Make common interactions as simple and easy as possible! Fewer steps is better!</li>
                    <li>Move important UI elements to the bottom of the screen, that is the spot that is easiest to reach.</li>
                    <li>Fast website loading is very important! Use SVG's if possible! Optimize your source code! </li>
                    <li>Simplify your forms and inputs! Nobody likes filling out forms, especially not on mobile devices</li>
                    <li>I disagree on showing passwords by default, that sends warning bells off in my head. I much prefer the pattern of hiding by default, and providing a way to show the password manually.</li>
                    <li>Don't try and be too clever with your inputs. People expect things to work a specific way, anything else will make them annoyed or anxious. That credit card field shown in Step 4 sucks really bad.</li>
                    <li>Be careful with your advertising, it is so easy to be overbearing!</li>
