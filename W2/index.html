                <h3>Reading: "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Programming Basics</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Direct Assignment and Assignment By Reference" is a really interesting facet of JavaScript! It's something that can really bite you in the butt if you don't keep it in mind. Immutable patterns really help in this regard, if you never mutate your objects you pretty much don't have to worry about assignment by reference.</li>
                        <li>Wrapper objects - I actually didn't know that JavaScript creates wrapper objects around primitive data types. I just assumed they were objects from the get go!</li>
                        <li>I didn't know Symbols existed, I'll have to look into them more!</li>
                        <li>Hard equality is good!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Arrays, Logic, and Loops</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I love destructuring! It's so convenient.</li>
                        <li>Sets are also pretty useful! Occasionally I find problems that are simplified a lot by Sets. Also, very useful for removing duplicates in an array :) Also didn't know about the memory leak stuff, I'll defintely keep that in mind going forward!</li>
                        <li>Maps are even more useful than Sets!</li>
                        <li>I don't use for loops so much anymore! I find the ES6 array methods so much more convenient.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Functions</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Love the arrow syntax. Makes creating anonymous functions a breeze!</li>
                        <li>Love map, reduce, and filter. I use them all the time! So much so I hardly ever use a for loop anymore.</li>
                    </ul>
