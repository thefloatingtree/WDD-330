                        <h3>Reading: "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition"</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Further Functions</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The fact that you can define new properties, and modify the behavior of functions at runtime in JavaScript is one of my favorite parts of it. It really increases the flexibility of the language, and you can do things that are just not possible in other languages.</li>
                                <li>Recursion is fun, or not, it's a bit of a brain bender! Also, something interesting is that JS has a recursion limit usually set to around 10,000. Although Firefox and Safari let you to up to 30,000 ish.</li>
                                <li>Promises are great! Also, they seem to be a very common solution to async code in other languages.</li>
                                <li>Async/Await is even better than using raw promises, although you are still using promises behind the scenes. Any function declared with 'async' returns a promise.</li>
                                <li>Clojures are indeed a bit hard to understand. But they're also fundemental for thinking about scope.</li>
                                <li>Generators are neat, but I haven't found many uses for them yet. They're a lot like the 'yeild' keyword in Python.</li>
                                <li>I really like the rules of functional programming. I think they really help to make clear and understandable code.</li>
                                <li>"Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both."</li>
                                <li>I like that general 'curry' function, but I cant see much use for it.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>AJAX</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fetch requests are so incredibly important for 90% of real web applications. A lot of the apps we build at the school are just toys, AJAX is the gateway to larger more complex apps.</li>
                                <li>It's interesting that the book seperates the headers and request objects into their own variables. I usually just use the 'fetch' function's interface to define that stuff. If I even need too, I usually find the default headers acceptable.</li>
                                <li>Please don't import jQuery just to make requests.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
